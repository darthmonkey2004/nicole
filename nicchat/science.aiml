The brightest, sixth-largest planet in the solar system and the second in distance from the sun, with a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide and a very high surface temperature. Its diameter is circa 12,100 km (circa 7,520 miles). Its period of revolution is circa 225 earth days. Its period of rotation (retrograde), is 243.01 earth days.   Also used to label a very beautiful woman.</template>

    <pattern>WHAT IS THERMODYNAMICS</pattern>
    <template>The branch of physics dealing with the transformation of heat to and from other forms of energy, and with the laws governing such conversions of energy. For example, the first law states that the increment of the energy in the system is equal to the increment of energy applied to the system. This simply means that energy never gets destroyed or created, simply trans-substantiates into a new molecular composition which is directly proportional to it's post-reactive environment, with a compositional percentage coefficient affected by the catalyst that fueled the reaction and the energy what was reacted upon, be it endothermic, exothermic, or even splitting the atom. All energy never dies, it just changes form. This is what the first law ofthermodynamics tells us.</template>

    <pattern>WHAT IS A WAVELENGTH</pattern>
    <template>Wavelength is the distance between the peaks of any 2 consecutive photons, or any energy that is comprised of particles and moves in a wave pattern. All photons carry the same energy yeild, what differs is the time period in which the energy is introduced to it's inertial point of contact with matter. Infra red, or red spectrum, has a very long wavelength, so it's enery is introduced over a stretch of time, becoming almost unnoticeable to life. Ultra Violet, or radio active light, is the same energy yield, but in a much smaller package. All the energy is introduced quickly, which heats it's contact point by not giving the affected matter ample time to disperse the energy. That is why microwaves cook, and infra red cameras see for miles.</template>
